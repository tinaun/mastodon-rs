Note: this is old and no longer mainatained (it never really was tbh). please use another framework like megalodon (https://github.com/h3poteto/megalodon-rs) instead.



# mastodon - rust client api for interacting with [mastodon](https://github.com/Gargron/mastodon) instances

this is very early in development, with only a few basic api endpoints implemented
you need to [generate an access token](https://github.com/Gargron/mastodon/wiki/Testing-with-cURL) manually, for now

see mod `tests` in src/lib.rs for basic use examples
